# Awesome list of pedagogy and training related resources

## Generic materials

### Books
- [Effective computation in Physics](http://physics.codes/). Although the examples use physical problems and `Python` code, this book is probably the best introduction to scientific computing.

### Scientific literature
- [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).
- [Good enough practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
- [Ten quick tips for teaching with participatory live coding](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090).
